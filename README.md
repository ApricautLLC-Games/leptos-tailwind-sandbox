# Sandbox for Friends-Connect

A playground for developing and testing client functionality for the [friends-connect](https://github.com/randallard/friends-connect) API.

## Prerequisites

- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) and Cargo
- [wasm-pack](https://rustwasm.github.io/wasm-pack/installer/) for WebAssembly compilation
- [Trunk](https://trunkrs.dev/#install) for bundling and serving

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/friends-connect-sandbox.git
cd friends-connect-sandbox
```

### 2. Testing

Testing your changes early helps identify issues in a clear progression:

**Windows:**
```
.\run_tests.ps1
```

**Linux/macOS:**
```
chmod +x run_tests.sh
./run_tests.sh
```

The test scripts will check for issues in this order:
1. Build errors (reported first if present)
2. Cargo test failures (standard Rust tests)
3. WebAssembly test failures (browser compatibility)

If all tests pass, you'll see "All tests passed successfully! ðŸŽ‰"

### 3. Running the development server

Once tests are passing, start the local development server:

```bash
trunk serve
```

This will compile and serve the application, typically at http://localhost:8080

### 4. Development environment

This project uses:
- [Leptos](https://leptos.dev/) for reactive web UI
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for styling

## Project Structure

- `index.html`: Entry point for the web application
- `src/`: Source code directory
- `run_tests.ps1`/`run_tests.sh`: Test scripts for Windows and Unix systems
