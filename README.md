# Sandbox for Friends-Connect

A playground for developing and testing client functionality for the [friends-connect](https://github.com/randallard/friends-connect) API.

## Prerequisites

- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) and Cargo
- [wasm-pack](https://rustwasm.github.io/wasm-pack/installer/) for WebAssembly compilation
- [Trunk](https://trunkrs.dev/#install) for bundling and serving

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/friends-connect-sandbox.git
cd friends-connect-sandbox
```

### 2. Testing and Running

The test scripts will automatically check your setup and start the development server if all tests pass:

**Windows:**
```
.\run_tests.ps1
```

**Linux/macOS:**
```
chmod +x run_tests.sh
./run_tests.sh
```

The scripts check for issues in this order:
1. Trunk.toml configuration file (will use defaults if not present)
2. Build errors (reported first if present)
3. Cargo test failures (standard Rust tests)
4. WebAssembly test failures (browser compatibility)

If all tests pass, you'll see "All tests passed successfully! ðŸŽ‰" and the development server will automatically start at http://localhost:8080.

To manually start the server without running tests:

```bash
trunk serve
```

### 3. Development environment

This project uses:
- [Leptos](https://leptos.dev/) for reactive web UI
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for styling

### 4. Configuration (Optional)

Trunk works without configuration, but you can create a `Trunk.toml` file in your project root to customize its behavior:

```bash
# Create a basic Trunk.toml file
touch Trunk.toml
```

Example `Trunk.toml` configuration:

```toml
[serve]
# Address to serve on
address = "127.0.0.1"
# Port to serve on
port = 8080
# Open a browser tab when server launches
open = true
```

See the example Trunk.toml file for more configuration options.

## Project Structure

- `index.html`: Entry point for the web application
- `src/`: Source code directory
- `run_tests.ps1`/`run_tests.sh`: Test scripts for Windows and Unix systems
